# blogTemplate  
Clean and responsive template where the important things are texts and images. You can see the preview [here](https://cmjcarlos7.github.io/blogTemplate/index.html).  
This template is develop to practice interfaces design and CSS.  

I have only used HTML, CSS and git. This template do not have javascript implemented.  
The icons and images are download from [icon8](https://icons8.com/icons) and [pixabay](https://pixabay.com/es/photos/japon/).  

In the future I want to create this template for Wordpress.

Options to improve:
* Add a slider for special categorys in index.html.  
* Add a instagram carousel in index.html.  
* Add comment to posts.
